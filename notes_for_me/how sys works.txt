ok so in this project everything is separated for admin and for web site.
-------
rotes are separate we have routes/admin and routes web
---------
main files of APP are separate we have views/Admin/app.blade.php  ||||||||||| views/app.blade.php
this is managed from  HandeInertiaRequests.php middleware  -> rootView

-------
in js we have separated views for admin and web it is managed from app.js file
if view starts with '@.' it is for admin and loaded admin folder
